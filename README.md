It should appear in your file explorer in downloads. Then right click on the folder and press "Extract All".

## Putting the data

Open up the extracted folder, which doesn't have a zipper on the icon. Inside you will see three text files, `email.txt`, `login_info.txt`, and `professor_list.txt`. Double click each file to open it, and inside there are instructions for what information goes inside.

## Running the program

Once you have filled out all the text files, open up the terminal.
Write `cd downloads` and press enter. Then write `cd Automated_Emails-main` and press enter. `Automated_Emails-main` is what the folder of this repository is saved as if you just download it as I have stated. If you renamed it use that name.

Now write `python program.py` and press enter. Wait for the program to stop running and print out `emails sent` in the console. Your emails have now been sent.

## Let me know if you have any problems running the program.
